## Prerequisites

- Install [Live2D Cubism Editor](https://www.live2d.com/en/cubism/download/editor/ "Live2D Cubism Editor")
- Install [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0 ".NET 6.0 SDK") or [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0 ".NET 8.0 SDK")

## How To Use

- Download LoveLive2D at [Releases](https://github.com/kiraio-moe/LoveLive2D/ "Releases") menu. Find your own platform then extract it.

### Windows

- Run `LoveLive2D.exe` (_**Run as Administrator if necessary**_) at the extracted archive.
- Select `CubismEditor{version}.exe` in your Live2D Cubism installation folder, either you want to patch or revoke the license.
- Alternatively, you can use Terminal. Replace `<action>` with `1` to **Patch** or `0` to **Revoke** license.

  ```bash
  LoveLive2D.exe <full_path_to_live2d_executable> <action>
  ```

### macOS

- Whitelist/allow `LoveLive2D` in the Developer settings, so it can run.
- Open a Terminal in the extracted folder.
- Add Execute permission:

  ```bash
  chmod +x ./LoveLive2D
  ```

- _Because of a library LoveLive2D used isn't yet implement APIs for macOS, you need to run LoveLive2D using Terminal_. Run with **root** permission.  
  Replace `<action>` with `1` to **Patch** or `0` to **Revoke** license:

  ```bash
  sudo ./LoveLive2D <full_path_to_live2d_executable.app> <action>
  ```

> [!NOTE]  
> If Live2D Cubism Editor ask you about offline use expiration date (forcing you to do online authentication), just ignore it forever. The patch will always bypass the offline expiration date.
